        <h1>oTranscribe Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p>oTranscribe, <a href="https://www.muckrock.com/about/">a service of the MuckRock Foundation</a>, respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy applies to our web site, www.oTranscribe.com (referred to herein as the oTranscribe Site or Site). This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect through the Site, how we use that information, and what choices you have.</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of any companies or individuals that oTranscribe does not control, or any web sites that you link to or from the oTranscribe Site. You should use caution and review the privacy policies of any external websites that you visit from the oTranscribe Site.</p>

        <p>By accessing the oTranscribe Site, you agree to accept its terms and conditions and are aware that our policies may evolve in the future.</p>

        <p><strong>What We Collect and How We Use the Information We Collect</strong></p>

        <p>We do not <b>not</b> store copies of your transcripts nor your audio or video files that you are currently transcribing.</p>

        <p>As part of the services provided by oTranscribe, we may collect some &quot;Personally Identifiable Information,&quot; such as your first name, last name, and e-mail address. You may optionally supply other information that can be used to contact you or identify you as an individual, including your postal address and phone number (collectively, “Optional Personally Identifiable Information”). We use Personally Identifiable Information and Optional Personally Identifiable Information to communicate with you and to assist in processing and managing your support requests (for example, when you email us with a question). If you make a donation or register for a mailing list, we may also require you to set up an account and, at that time, oTranscribe will collect your username, user ID number, and a hashed password. </p>

        <p>While this information is not required to use our services, oTranscribe may additionally collect the following information in order to process donations, support tickets, or allow you to purchase merchandise: your account type, your Stripe ID associated with your credit card information, your MuckRock user profile URL, your last login and the date you joined, and the Organization your MuckRock account is associated with. </p>

        <p>Our payment processor, Stripe, collects and stores information necessary for making payments including your credit card information, your e-mail address, your Stripe ID, the date you registered, your MuckRock username, your subscription information, and logs of certain activities and interactions (<em>e.g.</em> when your account was created and every transaction you make with Stripe).</p>

        <p><strong>How We Store Information We Collect</strong></p>

        <p>Except for the information collected and stored by Stripe (as described above), all other information is stored by oTranscribe inside MuckRock's Django app.</p>

        <p>Except as noted below, oTranscribe does not share your Personally Identifiable Information with third parties unless you give us your permission or we need to share such information in order to provide the services you have requested. When we supply Personally Identifiable Information to these third parties, we require them to use it only for the function they are helping us with.</p>

        <p>We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information when required by law or under the good-faith belief that such disclosure is necessary in order to conform to applicable law, comply with subpoenas, court orders or legal process served on oTranscribe, to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims, and to protect the property or interests of oTranscribe, its agents and employees, personal safety, or the public. If we become part of another organization, including without limitation, by merger, change of control, sale of assets, or other acquisition, the acquiring organization will obtain and have access to the Personally Identifiable Information collected by oTranscribe and it will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personally Identifiable Information as described in this Privacy Policy. If we cease operation, your information may be transferred to and used by another company that offers similar or related products or services. </p>

Should you no longer wish information you have submitted to us be stored by oTranscribe, you must send a request via e-mail to info@muckrock.com. Deletion requests will be complied with within 10 days of their submission.</p>

        <p> We keep the Personally Identifiable Information you provide on servers that are protected by technological means against intrusion and unauthorized access. </p>

        <p>To help protect your privacy, be sure: not to share your user ID or password with anyone else; to log off the oTranscribe Site when you are finished; and to take customary precautions to guard against “malware” (<em>e.g.</em> viruses, Trojan horses, bots, etc.), for example, by installing and updating suitable anti-virus software.</p>

        <p> oTranscribe does not control, and is not responsible for, the use of any information or content that you have exposed to the public through your use of the oTranscribe Site.</p>

We endeavor to notify you of any material change to the Policy by sending a notice to the e-mail address you have provided or by posting a notice of such changes on the oTranscribe Site. Unless otherwise provided, the revised terms will take effect on the date they are posted.
